LET US NOT WALLOW IN THE VALLEY OF DESPAIR. I SAY TO YOU TODAY MY FRIENDS -- SO EVEN THOUGH WE
FACE THE DIFFICULTIES OF TODAY AND TOMORROW, I STILL HAVE A DREAM. IT IS A DREAM DEEPLY ROOTED
IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY THIS NATION WILL RISE UP AND LIVE OUT THE TRUE
MEANING OF ITS CREED: "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL."
I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY ON THE RED HILLS OF GEORGIA THE SONS OF FORMER SLAVES AND THE SONS
OF FORMER SLAVE OWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER AT THE TABLE OF BROTHERHOOD. I HAVE A
DREAM THAT ONE DAY EVEN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, A STATE SWELTERING WITH THE HEAT OF INJUSTICE,
SWELTERING WITH THE HEAT OF OPPRESSION, WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO AN OASIS OF FREEDOM AND
JUSTICE. I HAVE A DREAM THAT MY FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WILL ONE DAY LIVE IN A NATION WHERE THEY WILL
NOT BE JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER. I HAVE A DREAM
TODAY. I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY DOWN IN ALABAMA, WITH ITS VICIOUS RACISTS, WITH ITS GOVERNOR
HAVING HIS LIPS DRIPPING WITH THE WORDS OF INTERPOSITION AND NULLIFICATION -- ONE DAY RIGHT
THERE IN ALABAMA LITTLE BLACK BOYS AND BLACK GIRLS WILL BE ABLE TO JOIN HANDS WITH LITTLE WHITE
BOYS AND WHITE GIRLS AS SISTERS AND BROTHERS. I HAVE A DREAM TODAY. I HAVE A DREAM THAT ONE DAY
EVERY VALLEY SHALL BE EXALTED, AND EVERY HILL AND MOUNTAIN SHALL BE MADE LOW, THE ROUGH PLACES
WILL BE MADE PLAIN, AND THE CROOKED PLACES WILL BE MADE STRAIGHT, AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD
SHALL BE REVEALED AND ALL FLESH SHALL SEE IT TOGETHER.
